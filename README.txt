This project uses threads to multiply two matrices together. The main class first checks to ensure the matrices can be multiplied together.
Then, each cell in the resulting is computing with a separate thread. Matrix A is matA.txt, matrix B is matB.txt, and the resulting matrix is 
matC.txt. Each cell in the matrix is separated by a space, and the rows are separated by lines. Negative numbers are allowed to be placed in the
matrices.

An example 3x3 matrix is:
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
